# Chess

### Description
Chess game programmed in .NET. The idea is to initially have the "Domain model" with the basic game, coupled to the console from the models, and with minimal functionality essential for two players. From there, transition to an MVC version, decoupling views, controllers, and models, and perhaps experimenting with a different MV*. Implement unit tests, apply some design patterns with some extra functionality like undo redo, implement data persistence, and finally adapt it to clean architectures such as clean architecture and finish with hexagonal architecture.

It's a practice to apply the various courses I have been taking lately on Design Patterns, Software Testing, and Architectures.
